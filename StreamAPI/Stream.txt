What is Stream API in Java?

The Stream API (introduced in Java 8) is used to process collections of data (like arrays, lists, sets) in a functional style.

ðŸ‘‰ Instead of writing loops (for, while), you can use streams to perform operations like filtering, mapping, sorting, reducing, etc.
 in a concise and readable way.

ðŸ“Œ Key Points

A Stream is not a data structure. It doesnâ€™t store elements.

It is a sequence of elements that supports pipeline operations.

Operations are of two types:

Intermediate Operations â†’ return a new stream (e.g., filter(), map(), sorted()).

Terminal Operations â†’ produce result (e.g., forEach(), collect(), reduce()).

ðŸ“Œ Stream API Workflow

Create a Stream (from collection, array, or generator).

Perform intermediate operations (transform/filter data).

Perform terminal operation (produce result).
