Java collection Framework is a Java.util package

Java collection Framework is having a set of Interfaces(List, Set, Map) and a set of Classes(ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap,, etc)

It is use to store and acess data more efficitently.

Tip: Think of the Collections Framework as a toolbox.
Interfaces like List define what tools can do, and classes like ArrayList are the actual tools that do the work.

Core Interfaces in the Collections Framework
Here are some common interfaces, along with their classes:

Interface	Common Classes	                        Description
List	    ArrayList, LinkedList	                Ordered collection that allows duplicates
Set	        HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet	        Collection of unique elements
Map	        HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap	        Stores key-value pairs with unique keys

Uses:
1. We can use LIST classes when we need to worry about the order, when we have duplicate values, and we need to access the elements by index.
2. We can use SET classes when we need to store on the unique values only.
3. We can use MAP classes when we need to store the pairs of keyes and values like name and its phone number.
