Both are mostly same 

LinkedList is a collection which can contain many objects of same type just like ArrayList.

However they are built diffrent but.

How ArrayList works??
  The ArrayList have a regular array inside it. When an element is added it it placed into the array.


How LinkedList works??
  LinkedList stores the element in a container, this List is linked to the first container and others are linked to its next,  w
  when a new element is add it is first added to the new container then the container is linked to other old ones.

  When To Use
Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.


**** LinkedList methods ****
1. addFirst(); -- Add element at the beginning of the List.
2. addLast();  -- Add element at the last.
3. removeFirst(); -- Removes the first element of the list.
4. removeLast(); -- Removes the last element.
5. getFirst(); -- gets the first element.
6. getLast(); -- gets the last element.
