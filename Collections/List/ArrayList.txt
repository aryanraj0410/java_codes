ArrayList is an resizable array.

ArrayList is also a part of java.util package and implements List interface.

The difference between a built in array and ArrayList is the built-in array cannot be modified if we have to add or remove elements
    then we have to make a whole new array.
    On the other hand in ArrayList we can perform whatever actions we want.

**** Create an ArrayList ****

We first need to import it from the util package.
import java.util.ArrayList;

**** Syntax ****

ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();    //create and ArrayList object


The List Interface
Note: Sometimes you will see both List and ArrayList in Java code, like this:

import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

List<String> cars = new ArrayList<>();
This means the variable (cars) is declared as a List (the interface), but it stores an ArrayList object (the actual list).

It works the same way, but some developers prefer this style because it gives them more flexibility to change the type later.
