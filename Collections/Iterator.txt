In Java, an Iterator is an object that is used to traverse (iterate) through a collection (like ArrayList, HashSet, etc.) 
one element at a time. It is part of the java.util package and provides methods to read, remove, and navigate elements in a collection.

Important Methods in Iterator

hasNext() → returns true if more elements are available.

next() → returns the next element.

remove() → removes the last element returned by the iterator.
