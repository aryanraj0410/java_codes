SET is an interface part of Java Collection Framework that is used to store a collection of unique element.

It doesnot allow duplicate elements. Also it does not preserve the order of element(unless TreeSet or LinkedHashSet).

Common classes that implement set:
 1. HashSet - fast and unordered
 2. TreeSet - sorted set
 3. LinkedHashSet - ordered by insertion

Common Set methods:

1. add()  -- adds element if not in set
2. remove() -- removes element form the set
3. contains() -- checks if the set contains the element.
4. size() -- returns the number of element.
5. clear() -- removes all element.
