List is a part of collection Framework

We can access elements by their index, add duplicates and maintain insertion order.

Since List is and Interface, therefore we cannot directly create List object,
We can use the Class that implement the List.

1. ArrayList
2. LinkedList

We have some common List methods;

1. add() -- when we need to add an element at the end.
2. get() -- when we need to get an element at any specified position.
3. set() -- when we need to replace an element at any specified position.
4. remove() -- when we need to remove an element for any specified position.
5. size() -- returns the number of elements in the List.
