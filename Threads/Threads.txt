Thread is like smallest execution inside a process.

Java runs minimun 1 thread.

But can runs many.
Threads are specific task that runs at the sametime to improve the effectiness of the code.
and make it more faster.


We can create Threads by 2 ways:

1. Extending a Thread class 
    class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

2. Implenting the Runnable interface
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}



Important Thread Methods

start() → starts a new thread (calls run() internally).

run() → contains the task to be executed.

sleep(ms) → pause thread for given milliseconds.

join() → waits for a thread to finish before continuing.

getName() → gets the thread name.

setName("name") → sets thread name.
