Generic in java is used for writing codes that are compatible with different data types.
We don't need to write the codes again and again for different datatypes like int, String, double etc.

Why we use??
We use Generics for
1. Type safety -- Catch type errors at compile time only.
2. Code reuseablity -- We dont have to write code blocks multiple times.
3. Avoid Type casting -- No need of manual type conversion.


Generics can be used in methods, classes, collections.

We can use bounded to limit the use of the datatype in the code.
bounded can be implemented by using extends keyword.
